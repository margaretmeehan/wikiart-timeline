It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic, on permanent display at the Musée du Louvre in Paris. The ambiguity of the subject's expression, frequently described as enigmatic, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modeling of forms and the atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work."},{"title":"The Starry Night","artistName":"van Gogh Vincent ","artistContentId":204915,"completitionYear":1889,"yearAsString":"1889","width":5000,"height":3959,"image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/00142/images/vincent-van-gogh/the-starry-night.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":207190,"artistUrl":"vincent-van-gogh","url":"the-starry-night-1889","location":"Saint-rémy-de-provenceFrance","period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"cloudscape","material":null,"style":"Post-Impressionism","technique":null,"sizeX":73,"sizeY":92,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York City, NY, US","tags":"houses-and-buildings, twilight-and-night, Arles, stars-and-planets","description":"Van Gogh's night sky is a field of roiling energy. Below the exploding stars, the village is a place of quiet order. Connecting earth and sky is the flamelike cypress, a tree traditionally associated with graveyards and mourning. But death was not ominous for van Gogh. \"Looking at the stars always makes me dream,\" he said, \"Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France? Just as we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star.\"\r\nThe artist wrote of his experience to his brother Theo: \"This morning I saw the country from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big.\" This morning star, or Venus, may be the large white star just left of center in The Starry Night. The hamlet, on the other hand, is invented, and the church spire evokes van Gogh's native land, the Netherlands. The painting, like its daytime companion, The Olive Trees, is rooted in imagination and memory. Leaving behind the Impressionist doctrine of truth to nature in favor of restless feeling and intense color, as in this highly charged picture, van Gogh made his work a touchstone for all subsequent Expressionist painting."},{"title":"The Persistence of Memory","artistName":"Dali Salvador","artistContentId":220740,"completitionYear":1931,"yearAsString":"1931","width":2105,"height":1600,"image":"https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/salvador-dali/the-persistence-of-memory-1931.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":221654,"artistUrl":"salvador-dali","url":"the-persistence-of-memory-1931","location":null,"period":"Surrealism Period (1929-1940)","serie":null,"genre":"symbolic painting","material":null,"style":"Surrealism","technique":null,"sizeX":33,"sizeY":24.1,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York City, NY, US","tags":null,"description":"The Persistence of Memory is by far Salvador Dali’s most recognizable painting, and there are many references to it in popular culture. Although it was conjectured that the soft melting watches were the result of Dali’s interpretation of the theory of relativity, Dali himself state that their inspiration was camembert cheese melting under the sun. The sequence of melting clocks in a disjointed landscape is the depiction of a dream that Dali had experienced, the figure in the middle of the painting being the face of the dreamer himself. The general interpretation is that the painting, which portrays many melting watches, is a rejection of time as a solid and deterministic influence.\r\nThis iconic and much-reproduced painting depicts time as a series of melting watches surrounded by swarming ants that hint at decay, an organic process in which Dali held an unshakeable fascination. Elaborated in the frontispiece to the Second Surrealist Manifesto, the seminal distinction between hard and soft objects, associated by Dali with order and putrefaction respectively, informs his working method in subverting inherent textual properties: the softening of hard objects and corresponding hardening of soft objects. It is likely that Dali was using the clocks to symbolize mortality (specifically his own) rather than literal time, as the melting flesh in the painting's center is loosely based on Dali's profile. The cliffs that provide the backdrop are taken from images of Catalonia, Dali's home.\r\n"},{"title":"In Bed, The Kiss","artistName":"Toulouse-Lautrec Henri de","artistContentId":230332,"completitionYear":1892,"yearAsString":"1892","width":1094,"height":815,"image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/henri-de-toulouse-lautrec/in-bed-the-kiss-1892.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":230453,"artistUrl":"henri-de-toulouse-lautrec","url":"in-bed-the-kiss-1892","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"genre painting","material":null,"style":"Post-Impressionism","technique":null,"sizeX":null,"sizeY":null,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Private Collection","tags":"couples, leisure-and-sleep","description":"This captivating 1892 artwork, In Bed: The Kiss, by Toulouse-Lautrec features two women caught up in a passionate moment.

Although a mythical figure, there is no exact literary context depicting the scene painted by Botticelli, leading to much speculation. As to its commission, the painting was solicited by a member of the Medici family, which is thought wanted to have a reproduction of an earlier work by a different artist, which had been lost after the rule of Nero.

No one else appeares in Monet's paintings as often as Camille. In those year, portraits of women were mostly ordered by bourgeois clients, but among progressive painters, the artistic structure became more important than the identity of the portrayed person. The masterly style, the lack of details, and the plainness of the colours led to a completely new directness of expression, independent of the facial gestures of the depicted person. In this picture, the shimmering reds, blues, greens, and white that capture the brilliance of a sun-drenched day are applied with many small brushstrokes, whose varied shapes create the different textures of flowers, grass, and clothing.

Magritte combined the words and image in such a fashion that he forces us to question the importance of the sentence and the word. \"Pipe,\" for instance, is no more an actual pipe than a picture of a pipe can be smoked. Magritte likely borrowed the pipe motif from Le Corbusier's book 'Vers une architecture' (1923), since he was admirer of the architect and painter, but he may also have been inspired by a comical sign he knew in an art gallery, which read, \"Ceci n'est pas de l'Art.\" The painting is the subject of a famous book-length analysis by Michel Foucault.

It was considered an affront to the times, not only because of the stark nudity of the woman in contrast to the men but also because Manet used familiar models for the figures in the painting. The nude woman is a combination of both his wife, Suzanne Leenhoff, and one of his other female models, Victorine Meurent. The men, on the other hand, are his brother, Eugene Manet, and his brother in law, Ferdinand Leenhoff. It was also considered controversial because it illustrated the rampant prostitution in Paris at the time, which was a taboo subject just to mention, much less display in an oversized canvas.

The triptych is generally thought to be a warning of the dangers of giving in to temptation, but has been subject to vast amounts of conjecture and scrutiny, and critics and historians are split in two directions. Whereas some believe that the middle panel, which depicts a fantastical world of nudes in sexual engagement, large fruits, and other suggestive elements, is simply an illustration of paradise lost, others believe that it is a moral warning, which will lead you to hell, as it is depicted in the third panel of the series.

Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer favored the arts, especially Klimt, and commissioned him to complete another portrait of his wife Adele in 1912. Adele Bloch-Bauer was the only person to be painted twice by Klimt. This painting is perhaps most famous not for its artistic quality, but because of its scandalous history since inception. Upon her death, Adele Bloch-Bauer wished the painting to be given to the Austrian State Gallery, but it was seized by advancing German forces in World War II. In 1945, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer designated the paintings to be the property of his nephew and nieces, including Maria Altmann. Nonetheless, the Austrian government retained ownership of the painting, and was not returned to the Altmann family until 2006 after a long court battle. The painting was then sold at auction for $135 million dollars, which at that time was the highest price paid at auction for a painting. It is now displayed the Neue Art Gallery in New York.

Also as one of his earlier paintings, it was still a clearly representational form of a tree. As a budding artist, Mondrian began painting simple pastoral landscapes of his home country, and these paintings evolved from those beginning artistic ideas. In the abstraction of the color of the tree and the simple design, Mondrian’s aesthetic style is already present in this simple landscape. This post-impressionistic piece was only a stepping stone in the artist’s development into his ideal form of neo-plasticism.

The figure in the paintings is a totalitarian black mass, with a mask-like face and hat resembling a cage.

The subtle shading evokes a host of textures exuding softness, warmth, and the absence of immediate tension. The robe has slipped off the sitter's shoulder, exposing her right breast. Coupled with the absent stare of the woman and the dog, the muted colors and faint contours give this composition an overall flatness.\n\nThe sitter is Kitty Garman, Freud's first wife, and a noted beauty whose father was artist Jacob Epstein. The dog was one of two bull terriers they were given as a wedding gift.\n\nFreud painted many portraits of Kitty during their brief marriage, which ended in divorce in 1952, due to his chronic infidelities. A weariness in the sitter's expression, the deep hollows under her eyes and the self-supporting gesture of the hand under the left breast hint at her discontent, despite this moment of calm. The analytic distance that came to characterize Freud's brilliance as an observer is reinforced by the absence of a name in the title, despite his intimate connection to the subjects. He was able to see certain things better because he remained aloof."},{"title":"The Desperate Man (Self-Portrait)","artistName":"Courbet Gustave","artistContentId":191705,"completitionYear":1845,"yearAsString":"1845","width":600,"height":491,"image":"https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/gustave-courbet/the-desperate-man-self-portrait-1845.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":191980,"artistUrl":"gustave-courbet","url":"the-desperate-man-self-portrait-1845","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"self-portrait","material":null,"style":"Romanticism","technique":null,"sizeX":54,"sizeY":45,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Private Collection","tags":"male-portraits, famous-people, Gustave-Courbet, characters-and-emotions","description":"Many of Courbet’s early paintings from the 1840’s are self-portraits, such as this one. As he had yet to truly develop his realistic painting style, many of these self-portraits are Romantic in style, illustrating the smooth lines and perfection of form of the Romantic school of painting. As a method of self-promotion and advertisement, Courbet made an impression with his self-portraits, and used them to find his own artistic style. After this period, Courbet became convinced that painters should illustrate the world around them as they see it and his realistic work in the later 1840’s gained support among younger realist and neo-romantic painters.

With its expressive colours, its flowing lines and striking overall effect, its appeal is universal.\r\n\r\nDespite radical simplification, the landscape in the picture is recognisable as the Kristiania Fjord seen from Ekeberg, with a broad view over the fjord, the town and the hills beyond. In the background to the left, at the end of the path with the balustrade that cuts diagonally across the picture, we see two strolling figures, often regarded as two friends whom Munch mentions in notes relating to the picture. But the figure in the foreground is the first to capture the viewer’s attention. Its hands are held to its head and its mouth is wide open in a silent scream, which is amplified by the undulating movement running through the surrounding landscape. The figure is ambiguous and it is hard to say whether it is a man or a woman, young or old – or even if it is human at all.\r\n\r\nAs with many of Munch’s pictures, it is assumed that here as well his starting point was private feelings and experience. His diaries contain several remarks that seem to form a background to this depiction of existential angst, among them the following: “I was walking along the road with two friends – Then the sun went down – The sky suddenly turned to blood and I felt a great scream in nature –”.\r\n\r\nThe Scream was first exhibited at Munch’s solo exhibition in Berlin in 1893. It was a central element in “The Frieze of Life”, and has been the theme of probing analysis and many suggested interpretations. The painting also exists in a later version, which is in the possession of the Munch Museum. In addition Munch worked with the motif in drawings, pastels and prints.\r\n"},{"title":"Dante and Virgil","artistName":"Bouguereau William-Adolphe","artistContentId":232329,"completitionYear":1850,"yearAsString":"1850","width":1608,"height":2001,"image":"https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/william-adolphe-bouguereau/dante-and-virgil-in-hell-1850.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":232375,"artistUrl":"william-adolphe-bouguereau","url":"dante-and-virgil-1850","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"illustration","material":null,"style":"Neoclassicism","technique":null,"sizeX":225,"sizeY":281,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Musée d'Orsay, Paris, France","tags":"sins-and-sinners, fictional-characters, Dante, Virgil, Dante-Alighieri-\"The-Divine-Comedy\"","description":"Having failed on two occasions to win the Prix de Rome (1848 and 1849), Bouguereau was hungry for revenge. His early submissions to the Salon reveal this fierce desire to succeed. After his ambitious Equality before Death (1849), the young man aimed to create an impression once again. He put forward an even larger painting inspired by Dante whose work was much loved by the Romantics and who captured all its dramatic beauty. This painting was inspired by a short scene from the Inferno, set in the eighth circle of Hell (the circle for falsifiers and counterfeiters), where Dante, accompanied by Virgil, watches a fight between two damned souls: Capocchio, a heretic and alchemist is attacked and bitten on the neck by Gianni Schicchi who had usurped the identity of a dead man in order to fraudulently claim his inheritance.\n\nThe critic and poet Théophile Gautier was very complimentary: \"Gianni Schicchi throws himself at Capocchio, his rival, with a strange fury, and Monsieur Bouguereau depicts magnificently through muscles, nerves, tendons and teeth, the struggle between the two combatants. There is bitterness and strength in this canvas – strength, a rare quality!” In fact, Bouguereau here shows great boldness. He is exploring the aesthetic boundaries: exaggerating the muscle structure to the point of distorting it, exaggerating the poses, contrasting colour and shadows, depicting monstrous figures and groups of damned souls. We are particularly reminded of the sublime visions of Romantic artists like Blake (1757-1827), Füssli (1741-1825), and Lawrence (1769-1830). Everything in this painting underlines the feeling of terribilita and horror: a theme to which Bouguereau would never again return."},{"title":"No.5/No.22","artistName":"Rothko Mark","artistContentId":242072,"completitionYear":1950,"yearAsString":"1950","width":1365,"height":1500,"image":"https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/mark-rothko/no-5-no-22.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":242109,"artistUrl":"mark-rothko","url":"no-5-no-22","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"abstract","material":null,"style":"Color Field Painting","technique":null,"sizeX":272,"sizeY":297,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York City, NY, US","tags":null,"description":"The rectangles within this painting do not extend to the edges of the canvas and appear to hover just over its surface.

At just 15, Picasso felt mature enough to take on large ambitious compositions as the culmination of his academic studies in Barcelona School of Fine Arts that were led by his father Jose Ruiz Picasso, who was the model for the doctor in this painting. Science and Charity was awarded an Honorary Mention at the General Fine Arts Exhibition in Madrid in spring 1897 and the Gold Medal at the Provincial Exhibition in Malaga held afterwards. After that, Joaquin Martinez de la Vega – a painter and a friend of Picasso’s father – held a glass of champagne and, letting a few drops fall on Picasso’s head, baptized him a Painter. And Picasso’s uncle, impressed by this wonderful achievement, sent money so that his nephew could study further in Madrid. However, despite the success, this would be Picasso’s last great work in traditional academic style. He left behind the intention, fostered by his father, to shape a career based on prizes and awards, to seek his artistic path outside and beyond the academy.

Delacroix wrote in a letter to his brother that a bad mood that had been hold of him was lifting due to the painting on which he was embarking (the Liberty painting), and that if he could not fight for his country then at least he would paint for it. The French government bought the painting in 1831, with plans to hang it in the room of the new king Louis-Philippe, but it was soon taken down for its revolutionary content. Lady Liberty was eventually the model for the Statue of Liberty, which was given to the United States 50 years later, and has also been featured on the French banknote.

Medicine was the second painting in the series, and depicted the river of life, and the continuity of life and death, and had no allusions to medicine or the science of healing. Because of this, he was attacked by critics, who pointed out that Vienna at the time was engaging in major medical advancements, and that the painting did not depict anything about either prevention or cure.

Designs for a further two sets also exist.\r\n\r\nThe idea of personifying the seasons was nothing new - examples could be found in the works of the Old Masters' as well as in Champenois's other publications. However, Mucha's nymph-like women set against the seasonal views of the countryside breathed new life into the classic theme. In the four panels shown here, Mucha captures the moods of the seasons - innocent Spring, sultry Summer, fruitful Autumn and frosty Winter, and together they represent the harmonious cycle of Nature."},{"title":"The Apparition","artistName":"Moreau Gustave","artistContentId":236529,"completitionYear":1876,"yearAsString":"1876","width":1252,"height":1897,"image":"https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/gustave-moreau/the-apparition-1876.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":236698,"artistUrl":"gustave-moreau","url":"the-apparition-1876","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"religious painting","material":null,"style":"Symbolism","technique":null,"sizeX":105,"sizeY":72,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Musée d'Orsay, Paris, France","tags":"Christianity, Salome, St. John the Baptist","description":null},{"title":"Musical Instruments","artistName":"Braque Georges ","artistContentId":193287,"completitionYear":1908,"yearAsString":"1908","width":1024,"height":826,"image":"https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/georges-braque/musical-instruments-1908.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":193667,"artistUrl":"georges-braque","url":"musical-instruments-1908","location":"France","period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"still life","material":null,"style":"Cubism","technique":null,"sizeX":61,"sizeY":50,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Kunstmuseum Basel, Basel, Switzerland","tags":"musical-instruments","description":null},{"title":"The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things","artistName":"Bosch Hieronymus","artistContentId":194778,"completitionYear":1485,"yearAsString":"1485","width":2863,"height":2441,"image":"https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/hieronymus-bosch/the-seven-deadly-sins-and-the-four-last-things-1485.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":195443,"artistUrl":"hieronymus-bosch","url":"the-seven-deadly-sins-and-the-four-last-things-1485","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"religious painting","material":null,"style":"Northern Renaissance","technique":null,"sizeX":120,"sizeY":150,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Museo del Prado, Madrid, Spain","tags":"allegories-and-symbols, Christianity, sins-and-sinners","description":"Unlike many of his works, in which Bosch used intricate levels of symbolism to represent his meaning, The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things literally represents the levels of sin, the punishments, and the eye of God watching over everything.

Those sent to hell for the sin of greed are boiled in pots of gold, and in the sin of pride a demon holds a mirror up to a prideful woman. The series of paintings is much more than a description of each sin and its punishment, as a whole it represents a warning to those who would engage in sin, and acts as a deterrent to evil doing.

Although he had included numbers and letters into a still life in 1910, they were a representational element of the painting. In this piece, the letters and numbers are a purely compositional addition. Braque’s intentions at adding the letters are many, but mostly they are added to make the viewer aware of the canvas itself. In representational paintings, the canvas is there only as a surface to hold whatever image the painter desires. By adding numbers, out of context elements, and surface textures, the viewer becomes aware of the fact that the canvas can also hold outside elements, making the surface of the painting just as important as what is put on top of it.

Although it was immediately condemned as “immoral” and “vulgar” by conservative critics, it was lauded by critics such as Emile Zola, the French writer, who proclaimed the painting to be Manet’s masterpiece. Unlike Titian’s Venus de Urbino or Giorgione’s Sleeping Venus, both of which were sources of inspiration for Olympia, Manet’s work was overtly sexual. The small bits of clothing, such as the orchid in her hair, jewelry, and the mule slippers, in addition to the fully clothed servant, seem to make the figure seem even more nude.

One of what is believed to be only five versions (green, blue, purple, yellow and here, red), made on this monumental scale, this vast but simple, even in some ways minimalist, image of the artist's famous but time-worn face peering tentatively out from under the wild hair of his instantly-recognizable 'fright-wig' is one of the great self-portrait images of the Twentieth Century. A comparatively rare self-exposure, the painting is a typically seamless fusion of painting and photography within one instantly unforgettable image. A vast, and somewhat morbid, icon of an icon, it is also, like so many artists' late self-portraits throughout history, a timeless portrait of a visibly aging master confronting the inevitability of his own imminent disappearance from the light of existence, in death. \r\n\r\nWarhol’s last series of self-portraits are among the most iconic, moving and ultimately profound works of his entire career. Among the very last paintings he executed before he did indeed suffer a premature and unexpected death - following complications that arose after a routine operation on his gall bladder in February 1987 - this series of self-portraits have consequently gained a prescience and an uncanny sense of timeliness that has done much to reinforce the legend of Warhol as a modern-day seer. The 'somewhat unearthly... and terrifying oracle' as Calvin Tomkins once described him, who 'made visible what was happening in some part to us all', seems here, in these works, to be foreseeing intimations of his own death.

was an inspiration for several female characters of Sandro Botticelli’s artworks. Viewed as a female ideal, the woman in this portrait has features considered to be perfect at that time. Until the present day, it has been speculated that the portrait of Simonetta is actually just an idealized version of the actual living muse of Florence, transpired into perfection through Botticelli’s mind eye. \n\nThe lore says that the maestro was in love with the young beauty, but never quite being able to fulfill this loving desire as she was a married woman. It is said that he painted her image to resemble how perfect she was to him, rather than to show her real beauty. He did not miss a chance to worship her by giving her the roles of high goddesses in his mythological themed paintings. Allegedly, Simonetta’s visage served as main inspiration for Pallas Athena ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/pallas-and-centaur][i]Pallas and Centaur[/i][/url], c.1482), Flora ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/primavera-1478][i]Primavera[/i][/url], 1478), and even for the infamous Venus in numerous instances ([url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/the-birth-of-venus-1485][i]The birth of Venus[/i][/url], 1485; [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/sandro-botticelli/venus-and-mars-1483-1][i]Venus and Mars[/i][/url], 1483); she also possibly was a prototype for [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/piero-di-cosimo]Piero di Cosimo[/url]’s  [url href=https://www.wikiart.org/en/piero-di-cosimo/portrait-of-simonetta-vespucci-as-cleopatra-1490][i]Portrait of a Woman[/i][/url] (1490).\n\nBotticelli’s portrait of “la bella Simonetta” reveals a specific technique developed in the early Renaissance years. In order to obtain the flawless complexion of the character, the artist uses a special mixture, terre verte - a green, earthy tone - to under paint, and afterward layers the flesh- like tones over it to create diverse shades of pink, yellow, and orange. Botticelli shows brilliant control of the tempera painting technique making use of fine lines and shapes to discreetly build up contrasts and create the depth and texture of the portrait."},{"title":"Exu","artistName":"Basquiat Jean-Michel

The painting changed hands many times, ending with a bidding war between France and America. The painting has also been a source of speculation, due to Salvador Dali’s insistence that the figures are actually praying over their deceased child. Dali was so insistent that the painting was eventually x-rayed, revealing a shape that looked like a small coffin, indicating that Dali may have been right, and that Millet may have originally created the painting with the couple mourning over their small child’s coffin.

In this painting, the easel used to paint the seascape outside of the doorway is also hiding the doorway, as well as the seascape. The image painted on the canvas also merges with the actual image outside of the doorway, making a seamless transition between the two.

One of the best-known images of 20th-century art, the painting depicts an all-night diner in which three customers, all lost in their own thoughts, have congregated. Fluorescent lights had just come into use in the early 1940s, and the all-night diner emits an eerie glow, like a beacon on the dark street corner. Hopper eliminated any reference to an entrance, and the viewer, drawn to the light, is shut out from the scene by a seamless wedge of glass. The four anonymous and uncommunicative night owls seem as separate and remote from the viewer as they are from one another. Reworked and parodied countless times, Nighthawks has become an icon of American culture."},{"title":"Sistine Chapel Ceiling: Creation of

It is one of the world's most famous paintings, and one of the most studied, scrutinized, and satirized.\r\nIt was important for humanism. The work is presumed to have been commenced around 1495 and was commissioned as part of a plan of renovations to the church and its convent buildings by Leonardo's patron Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. The painting represents the scene of The Last Supper of Jesus with his disciples, as it is told in the Gospel of John, 13:21. Leonardo has depicted the consternation that occurred among the Twelve Disciples when Jesus announced that one of them would betray him.\r\nDue to the methods used, and a variety of environmental factors, as well as intentional damage, very little of the original painting remains today, despite numerous restoration attempts, the last being completed in 1999."},{"title":"The Nostalgia of the Infinite","artistName":"de Chirico Giorgio ","artistContentId":194416,"completitionYear":1913,"yearAsString":"1913","width":613,"height":1375,"image":"https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/giorgio-de-chirico/the-nostalgia-of-the-infinite-1913.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":194606,"artistUrl":"giorgio-de-chirico","url":"the-nostalgia-of-the-infinite-1913","location":"ParisFrance","period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"cityscape","material":null,"style":"Metaphysical art","technique":null,"sizeX":52.5,"sizeY":123.5,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York City, NY, US","tags":"gates-and-towers","description":"This painting is an example of the tower theme, which was a recurring element in De Chirico’s works, The Nostalgia of the Infinite of which is the most famous. According to art historian Robert Hughes, the tower draws inspiration from the Mole Antonelliana, a landmark tower in the city of Turin, Italy. During his travels as an emerging artist, De Chirico traveled to Turin, and was inspired by its metaphysical presence, especially the architecture of its piazzas and archways. It was also a city he connected with Nietzsche, who occasionally summered in Turin, and of whose philosophy De Chirico was a follower. In modern media, this image has influenced the painting for the box cover of the video game Ico, which draws artistic inspiration from the many vast and lonely expanses apparent in De Chirico’s works."},{"title":"Print Gallery","artistName":"Escher M.C.","artistContentId":204422,"completitionYear":1956,"yearAsString":"1956","width":1280,"height":1286,"image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/m-c-escher/print-gallery.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":204786,"artistUrl":"m-c-escher","url":"print-gallery","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"cityscape","material":null,"style":"Surrealism","technique":null,"sizeX":null,"sizeY":null,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":null,"tags":"houses-and-buildings","description":null},{"title":"Woman and Horses","artistName":"Ocampo Octavio","artistContentId":250832,"completitionYear":null,"yearAsString":"","width":1200,"height":1600,"image":"https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/octavio-ocampo/woman-and-horses.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":250867,"artistUrl":"octavio-ocampo","url":"woman-and-horses","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"portrait","material":null,"style":"Surrealism","technique":null,"sizeX":null,"sizeY":null,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":null,"tags":"female-portraits","description":null},{"title":"At the Moulin Rouge, The Dance","artistName":"Toulouse-Lautrec Henri de","artistContentId":230332,"completitionYear":1890,"yearAsString":"1890","width":2536,"height":1950,"image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/henri-de-toulouse-lautrec/at-the-moulin-rouge-the-dance-1890.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":230372,"artistUrl":"henri-de-toulouse-lautrec","url":"at-the-moulin-rouge-the-dance-1890","location":"ParisFrance","period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"genre painting","material":null,"style":"Art Nouveau (Modern), Post-Impressionism","technique":null,"sizeX":150,"sizeY":115.5,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, PA, US","tags":null,"description":"A recently discovered penciled inscription, in the artist's hand, on the back of this famous painting reads: \"The instruction of the new ones by Valentine the Boneless.\" Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was thus not depicting an ordinary evening at the Moulin Rouge, the fashionable Parisian nightclub but rather a specific moment when a man now known only by his nickname (which certainly describes his nimbleness as a dancer) appears to be teaching the \"can-can.\" Many of the inhabitants of the scene are well-known members of Lautrec's demimonde of prostitutes and artists and people seen only at night including the white-bearded Irish poet William Butler Yeats who leans on the bar.

As evidenced by the name, many of De Chirico’s works were inspired by the feelings evoked by travel and departure.

Brueghel casts the entire work in a reddish-brown tone that gives the scene an infernal aspect appropriate for the subject at hand. The profusion of scenes and moralizing sense applied by the artists are part of Hieronymous Bosch´s influence on this work. Bruegel combines two distinct visual traditions within the panel. These are his native tradition of Northern woodcuts of the Dance of Death and the Italian conception of the Triumph of Death, as in frescoes he would have seen in the Palazzo Sclafani in Palermo and in the Camposanto Monumentale at Pisa."},{"title":"Landscape drawing for Santa Maria della Neve","artistName":"da Vinci

Manet, whose paintings often depicted scenes of leisurely activities, has included many of his friends as well as a self portrait in this work.

As the story goes, while Danae was imprisoned by her father, she was visited by Zeus, in the form of the golden rain flowing between her legs. Soon after Zeus’ visit, Danae became pregnant and gave birth to her son Perseus.

This composition is an illustration of Klee’s ability to use intonations of color to evoke a musical feeling. He begins the composition with the large rectangle in the center, then builds upon it’s strength and color to build the remainder of the composition, which flows from the first large note.

As it was meant solely for the exhibition, Klimt painted the mural lightly on the walls at the Vienna Secession Building. After the exhibition, the painting was preserved, but it was not again displayed until 1986, where it remains on display today. The mural’s popularity has cemented its fame as portions of it were printed on the Austrian 100 euro coin in 2004. The coin contains less suggestive elements of the painting, including a knight in armor symbolizing strength, a woman holding a wreath of victory symbolizing ambition, and a woman with head held down and clasped hands, symbolizing sympathy.

This piece represents another development in the unique style of the artist, which may have been the most profound. After the abandonment of representational forms in 1913 and the reconciliation of his spiritual concerns with his aesthetic, Mondrian had finally developed the transition of solid black lines to lines consisting of multi-colored, vibrant hues, creating an entirely new feeling. This painting represents Mondrian’s seminal work as an artist, and unlike much of his work, is not entirely non-representational. One can see the grid of the Manhattan city streets and feel the beat of the boogie woogie music of which Mondrian was so fond."},{"title":"Blue rider","artistName":"Kandinsky Wassily","artistContentId":189246,"completitionYear":1903,"yearAsString":"1903","width":664,"height":623,"image":"https://uploads4.wikiart.org/images/wassily-kandinsky/blue-rider-1903.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":189273,"artistUrl":"wassily-kandinsky","url":"blue-rider-1903","location":"Munich / MonacoGermany","period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"landscape","material":null,"style":"Expressionism","technique":null,"sizeX":65,"sizeY":55,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Private Collection","tags":"horsemen, forests-and-trees","description":"The Blue Rider is perhaps Kandinsky’s most important painting from the early 1900’s, before he had fully developed his abstract style of music as sound. The painting illustrates a rider cloaked in blue, speeding through a greenish meadow. The painting’s intentional abstractness had led many art theorists to project their own representations onto the figure, some seeing a child in the arms of the blue rider. Allowing viewers to participate in the representations of the art was a technique that Kandinsky would use to great fruition in his many later works, which became more and more abstract as his career wore on."},{"title":"The Pine Tree at St. Tropez","artistName":"Signac

time. He first outlined the work on an oversized wooden panel, but soon experienced an artistic block, and found himself unable to paint. Gabrielle Munter, his assistant at the time, told him that he was blocked, and he needed to release himself from his intellectual trappings surrounding the painting. She suggested that he simply repeat the word “uberflut,” meaning “flood” or “deluge,” focusing on the sound of the word rather than its meaning, releasing his mind from the artistic block and focusing only on the music of the word. Kandinsky set down to work, and completed the painting in three days, all the while repeating the word like a mantra.

He included the images of his wife, Frida Kahlo, woodcarver Dudley C. Carter, and himself, planting a tree and holding the hand of actress Paulette Goddard, and was assisted in the project by Thelma Johnson Streat, an African-American artist and textile designer.

The Queen is perhaps his most powerful and globally recognizable subject. While Freud normally worked large, this composition measures approximately nine and a half by six inches, making it one of his smallest paintings. Nonetheless, it depicts the British monarch as an imposing presence. The entire composition is filled by her face. A sliver of pearls adorns her throat, while atop her white hair is an elaborate, jeweled crown. The symmetrical details in the jewels and hair mark the parameters of the picture, and serve as a kind of psychic boundary for the work. The crown, an item Freud specifically requested she wear for the portrait, dominates the upper border of the picture.\n\nAfter agreeing to pose for the artist, the Queen met Freud for a sitting in May of 2000. Making an exception from his usual practice of making a studio appointment, Freud traveled for sittings to St. James Palace at the Royal Collection's Friary Court, where she sat for him at the picture conservation studio. The small canvas took over six months to complete and was finally finished in December of 2001. By the time he was ready to paint the crown the Queen, who had other obligations, had run out of time. So a model had to be used. Freud, always a lightning rod for controversy, was accused of painting the Queen in an unflattering and unduly harsh light.\n\nThe project sparked debate and got mixed reviews (some saw it as a cheap publicity stunt by an artist with fading talent). Yet in his forthright observation of the Queen's features, one sees a raw intensity Freud had maintained throughout his career and refused to minimize, regardless of his subject. Among the more intriguing interpretations of this portrait, recently discussed by independent art historian Simon Abrahams, is that the Queen is a symbolic stand-in for the artist himself, a kind of alter-ego. The Queen's aging features in this portrait are remarkably similar to those of Freud himself, and the British press complained that the portrait looked nothing like her, adding credence to the theory."},{"title":"The Beethoven Frieze: The Longing for Happiness Finds Repose in Poetry.

As it was meant solely for the exhibition, Klimt painted the mural lightly on the walls at the Vienna Secession Building. After the exhibition, the painting was preserved, but it was not again displayed until 1986, where it remains on display today. The mural’s popularity has cemented its fame as portions of it were printed on the Austrian 100 euro coin in 2004. The coin contains less suggestive elements of the painting, including a knight in armor symbolizing strength, a woman holding a wreath of victory symbolizing ambition, and a woman with head held down and clasped hands, symbolizing sympathy.

It includes a depiction of the lips of his departed lover, Lee Miller, floating in the sky above the Paris Observatory. In the photograph, the nude is lying on her side on a sofa underneath the painting, with a chessboard at her feet. Observatory Time hints at what the woman might be dreaming: a nightmare or an erotic fantasy.

Christ's insignificance among the crowds is a familiar device of mannerist painting, as is the artificial placing of Mary and her companions in a rocky foreground, which is deliberately distanced from the dramatic events taking place behind them."},{"title":"Obnoxious Liberals","artistName":"Basquiat Jean-Michel ","artistContentId":203777,"completitionYear":1982,"yearAsString":"1982","width":2361,"height":1575,"image":"https://uploads1.wikiart.org/images/jean-michel-basquiat/obnoxious-liberals.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":203890,"artistUrl":"jean-michel-basquiat","url":"obnoxious-liberals","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"figurative","material":null,"style":"Neo-Expressionism","technique":null,"sizeX":259.1,"sizeY":172.7,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Broad, Los Angeles, CA, US","tags":null,"description":null},{"title":"Jimmy Best...","artistName":"Basquiat Jean-Michel ","artistContentId":203777,"completitionYear":1981,"yearAsString":"1981","width":1976,"height":1998,"image":"https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/jean-michel-basquiat/jimmy-best.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":203842,"artistUrl":"jean-michel-basquiat","url":"jimmy-best","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"figurative","material":null,"style":"Neo-Expressionism","technique":null,"sizeX":244,"sizeY":244,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Private Collection","tags":null,"description":null},{"title":"Helmet","artistName":"Basquiat Jean-Michel ","artistContentId":203777,"completitionYear":1981,"yearAsString":"1981","width":1236,"height":928,"image":"https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/jean-michel-basquiat/helmet.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":203829,"artistUrl":"jean-michel-basquiat","url":"helmet","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"sculpture","material":null,"style":"Neo-Expressionism","technique":null,"sizeX":20.3,"sizeY":22.8,"diameter":33,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Private Collection","tags":"helmets","description":null},{"title":"Perspective drawing for Church of Santo Spirito in Florence","artistName":"Brunelleschi Filippo","artistContentId":230928,"completitionYear":1428,"yearAsString":"1428","width":448,"height":351,"image":"https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/filippo-brunelleschi/perspective-drawing-for-church-of-santo-spirito-in-florence.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":230939,"artistUrl":"filippo-brunelleschi","url":"perspective-drawing-for-church-of-santo-spirito-in-florence","location":"Italy","period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"design","material":null,"style":"Early Renaissance","technique":null,"sizeX":null,"sizeY":null,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":null,"tags":"designs-and-sketches, arcades-and-colonnades, architectural drawings","description":null},{"title":"Over the town","artistName":"Chagall Marc","artistContentId":202355,"completitionYear":1918,"yearAsString":"1918","width":800,"height":619,"image":"https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/marc-chagall/over-the-town-1918.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":202896,"artistUrl":"marc-chagall","url":"over-the-town-1918","location":"Liozna, near VitebskBelarus","period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"symbolic painting","material":null,"style":"Cubism","technique":null,"sizeX":56,"sizeY":45,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, Russia","tags":"allegories-and-symbols, couples, flying","description":null},{"title":"Number 1 (Lavender Mist)","artistName":"Pollock Jackson ","artistContentId":184856,"completitionYear":1950,"yearAsString":"1950","width":1024,"height":749,"image":"https://uploads2.wikiart.org/number-1-lavender-mist(1).jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":185307,"artistUrl":"jackson-pollock","url":"number-1-lavender-mist-1950-1","location":null,"period":"Drip period","serie":null,"genre":"abstract","material":null,"style":"Action painting","technique":null,"sizeX":null,"sizeY":null,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":null,"tags":null,"description":"Through his drip action technique, Pollock would create layers upon layers of paint, created in a chaotic assemblage of drips and splashes.

The Monet family was living in a house that Manet had helped them find the year before. This portrait of the Monet family—Camille Monet and Jean, with Claude Monet gardening at the left—is one of Manet's most significant essays in this new style. While Manet painted the Monet family, Renoir painted beside him and Monet worked nearby. Monet painted Manet at his easel (present location unknown), while Renoir, like Manet, painted Madame Monet, Jean Monet, and the rooster (http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/pierre-auguste-renoir/camille-monet-and-her-son-jean-in-the-garden-at-argenteuil-1874). In 1924, Monet recounted the circumstances of the day in his garden at Argenteuil: \"Manet, enthralled by the color and the light, undertook an outdoor painting of figures under trees. During the sitting, Renoir arrived. . . . He asked me for palette, brush and canvas, and there he was, painting away alongside Manet. The latter was watching him out of the corner of his eye. . . . Then he made a face, passed discreetly near me, and whispered in my ear about Renoir: 'He has no talent, that boy!

The painting has an enormous internal energy. The crossing diagonals forming the borders of the fields and the ploughed furrows, the contours of the roofs, the row of cypresses - such vectors strain the composition, but not so much as to disturb the unity of the whole.

more specifically an assisted ready-made. The readymade involves taking mundane, often utilitarian objects not generally considered to be art and transforming them, by adding to them, changing them, or (as in the case of his most famous work 'Fountain') simply renaming them and placing them in a gallery setting. In L.H.O.O.Q. the objet trouvé (\"found object\") is a cheap postcard reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa onto which Duchamp drew a moustache and beard in pencil and appended the title.  Although many say it was pioneered by him, in 1883 Eugène Bataille created a Mona Lisa smoking a pipe, titled Le rire.\r\n\r\n"},{"title":"On White II","artistName":"Kandinsky Wassily","artistContentId":189246,"completitionYear":1923,"yearAsString":"1923","width":510,"height":620,"image":"https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/wassily-kandinsky/on-white-ii-1923.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":189374,"artistUrl":"wassily-kandinsky","url":"on-white-ii-1923","location":"Germany","period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"abstract","material":null,"style":"Abstract Art","technique":null,"sizeX":98,"sizeY":105,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Georges Pompidou Center, Paris, France","tags":null,"description":"Kandinsky’s On White II expresses an intelligent combination of the two main colors in the painting: black and white.

The color black, on the other hand, represents non-existence and death.

of the most famous paintings in Russian art, Black Square marked the turning point of the Russian avant-garde movement. Before creating this painting, Malevich spent eighteen months in his studio, laboring over thirty non-objective paintings. In the end, he had created a series of non-objective paintings, of which Black Square is one. His invention of the word “suprematism” was meant to refer to the supremacy of the new geometric forms. Although the other works in this period were created with visual brushstrokes and asymmetrical forms, Black Square was the prominent piece, with no visual textures and a perfectly symmetrical shape, as it was the paramount of Malevich’s change to pure geometric abstraction: suprematism.

He produced this politically charged work in support of the Red Army shortly after the Bolsheviks had waged their revolution in 1917. The red wedge symbolized the revolutionaries, who were penetrating the anti-Communist White Army. Here Lissitzky uses his signature coded color combination of red, white and black, which reinforces the message indicated by the work's title. Colors and shapes take on directly symbolic significance. For example, the smooth, curvilinear walls of the white circle are pierced by the sharp point of the red triangle: the Red Army has pierced the defenses of the White Army. Dramatic color contrasts also create confusion regarding space-which area is positive? Which is negative? Meanwhile, small geometric forms in the limited color scheme float like tiny projectiles through the space along with text. Here, basic forms combine with actual text: painting and typography are fused. This work is an important precursor to Lissitzky's Prouns, when Suprematist art moved onto a three-dimensional visual plain."},{"title":"Poppy Field in Giverny","artistName":"Monet Claude","artistContentId":211667,"completitionYear":1890,"yearAsString":"1890","width":1280,"height":759,"image":"https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/claude-monet/poppy-field-in-giverny.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":212224,"artistUrl":"claude-monet","url":"poppy-field-in-giverny","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"landscape","material":null,"style":"Impressionism","technique":null,"sizeX":null,"sizeY":null,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":null,"tags":null,"description":null},{"title":"The Joy of Life","artistName":"Matisse Henri","artistContentId":213888,"completitionYear":1906,"yearAsString":"1906","width":1088,"height":784,"image":"https://uploads5.wikiart.org/images/henri-matisse/the-joy-of-life-1906.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":214263,"artistUrl":"henri-matisse","url":"the-joy-of-life-1906","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"genre painting","material":null,"style":"Fauvism","technique":null,"sizeX":241,"sizeY":175,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Barnes Foundation, Lower Merion, PA, US","tags":null,"description":"During his Fauve years Matisse often painted landscapes in the south of France during the summer and worked up ideas developed there into larger compositions upon his return to Paris.

The scene is made up of independent motifs arranged to form a complete composition. The massive painting and its shocking colors received mixed reviews at the Salon des Indépendants.

She lives isolated in a tower on an island called Shalott, on a river which flows down from King Arthur’s castle at Camelot. Not daring to look upon reality, she is allowed to see the outside world only through its reflection in a mirror. One day she glimpses the reflected image of the handsome knight Lancelot, and cannot resist looking at him directly. The mirror cracks from side to side, and she feels the curse come upon her. The punishment that follows results in her drifting in her boat downstream to Camelot ‘singing her last song’, but dying before she reaches there. Waterhouse shows her letting go the boat’s chain, while staring at a crucifix placed in front of three guttering candles. Tennyson was a popular subject for artists of this period, particularly the Pre-Raphaelites. Waterhouse’s biographer Anthony Hobson relates that the artist owned a copy of Tennyson’s collected works, and covered every blank page with pencil sketches for paintings.\n\nThe landscape setting is highly naturalistic; the painting was made during Waterhouse’s brief period of plein-air painting. The setting is not identified, although the Waterhouses frequently visited Somerset and Devon. The model is traditionally said to be the artist’s wife. Waterhouse’s sketchbook contains numerous pencil studies for this and the painting of the same title made six years later (1894, Leeds City Art Gallery). This second work shows the Lady at the moment she looks out of the window and the curse is fulfilled. Waterhouse also made sketches of the final scenes in which the boat bearing the Lady floats into Camelot."},{"title":"Skull","artistName":"Ocampo Octavio","artistContentId":250832,"completitionYear":null,"yearAsString":"","width":458,"height":648,"image":"https://uploads0.wikiart.org/images/octavio-ocampo/skull.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":250862,"artistUrl":"octavio-ocampo","url":"skull","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"portrait","material":null,"style":"Surrealism","technique":null,"sizeX":null,"sizeY":null,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":null,"tags":"female-portraits","description":null},{"title":"Portrait of a Young Man","artistName":"Freud Lucian","artistContentId":231885,"completitionYear":1944,"yearAsString":"1944","width":1003,"height":1142,"image":"https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/lucian-freud/portrait-of-a-young-man.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":232089,"artistUrl":"lucian-freud","url":"portrait-of-a-young-man","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"portrait","material":null,"style":"Surrealism","technique":null,"sizeX":27.94,"sizeY":null,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Private Collection","tags":"male-portraits","description":null},{"title":"Tahitian mountains","artistName":"Gauguin Paul ","artistContentId":190436,"completitionYear":1893,"yearAsString":"1893","width":1126,"height":832,"image":"https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/paul-gauguin/tahitian-mountains-1893.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":190808,"artistUrl":"paul-gauguin","url":"tahitian-mountains-1893","location":"French Polynesia","period":"1st Tahiti period","serie":null,"genre":"landscape","material":null,"style":"Cloisonnism","technique":null,"sizeX":93,"sizeY":73,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":null,"tags":"Tahiti, mountains","description":null},{"title":"Hotel Bedroom","artistName":"Freud Lucian","artistContentId":231885,"completitionYear":1954,"yearAsString":"1954","width":1111,"height":1662,"image":"https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/lucian-freud/hotel-bedroom.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":232010,"artistUrl":"lucian-freud","url":"hotel-bedroom","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"genre painting, self-portrait","material":null,"style":"Expressionism","technique":null,"sizeX":null,"sizeY":null,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Beaverbrook Art Gallery, Fredericton, Canada","tags":"female-portraits","description":"Settling in Paris in 1952, Freud painted many portraits, including Hotel Bedroom (1954), which features a woman lying in a bed with white sheets pulled up to her shoulders. Her left hand rests on her cheek, and her gaze is fixed on a faraway place. In sharp contrast, a standing man is standing behind her and staring at her. His dark form looms over her menacingly, silhouetted against the sunlight. Other windows in the building across the street are visible in the background.\n\nThe man is Freud himself, and the woman is Lady Caroline Hamilton Temple Blackwood, the Guinness ale heiress with whom he eloped in 1952 after the divorce from his first wife. At the time they were staying at the Hotel La Louisiane, and the work reflects the anxiety and tension in their relationship, which had already begun to unravel. She would soon leave him, and the distraught Freud, while having many more relationships, would never marry again. This painting is among the works that Freud exhibited it at the Venice Biennale when he was invited to serve as the representative of Britain in 1954, a great honor. Like this and other early portraits by the artist, the work has a flat, drawing-like quality. Here, however, the body of the artist is a black hole, threatening to suck the light out of the rest of the picture. The artist's standing pose also seems to predict a turning point in his working method. This is the last portrait he completed while sitting down. From that point on, he chose to stand while painting. One of his more narrative works, it exemplifies the autobiographical self-absorption and detachment associated with his later work."},{"title":"Cat and Bird","artistName":"Klee

overseas. It depicts Mount Fuji in a deep, saturated red; thin white lines of snow tracing lines down from the tip of the peak. Small clusters of clouds fill the sky, and tiny trees grow to the base of the mountain, indicating its massive size. Hokusai’s infatuation with Mount Fuji was much more than an admiration of its beauty. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter told that a goddess placed an elixir of life at the top of the peak, and thus the mountain was a secret source of immortality, as well as a secret reason for Hokusai’ obsession with the mountain.

In addition to theatre costumes and set designs, tapestries, and designs and decorations for court celebrations, he also dabbled in gouache. This piece is one of only three gouache paintings by the artist. This piece, which was probably produced as an independent work, rather than as a study for a painting, bears a striking resemblance to another one of his paintings, Venus on the Waves. Boucher was a master at depicting idyllic classical scenes, and in this one we see his adeptness at portraying the mythical scene of impassive Venus, surrounded by nymphs and tritons, all paying tribute to the goddess of love.

angel. As if in a modern-day wrestling arena, French women watch the wrestling match from afar. This painting was created during Gaugin’s stay in Pont-Avon, France, which is where he created his other masterpieces, The Yellow Christ and The Green Christ. This painting also incorporates elements from his Christ series, which also place Breton French women alongside a Biblical scene, placing them as observers in the story. In his typical style, flat areas of color are outlined by thick black lines, and the figures are void of any shading or depth of color.

commemorate the invasion of Spain by Napoleon’s troops in 1808. At the time it was painted, the painting was considered groundbreaking and revolutionary, as it presents the horrors of war that had heretofore not been openly illustrated. The painting focuses on one man, illuminated in white light in the middle of the painting, arms held out to the sides, facing a French firing squad. His slain companions litter the ground. It is thus considered one of the first pieces of modern art. This painting has influence a number of other artists, who have directly referenced the style and setting of the painting, including Edouard Manet and Pablo Picasso.

Italy","tags":"Greek-and-Roman-Mythology, beasts-and-dragons","description":"Caravaggio (1571-1610) painted two versions of the Head of Medusa. The first in 1596 and the other presumably in 1597/8. The first version also known as Murtula, due to the poet who wrote about it (48x55 cm) is signed Michel A F, (Michel Angelo Fecit) and was found on the painter’s studio only after his dead. Nowadays it belongs to a private collection whilst the second version, slightly bigger (60 x 55 cm) is not signed and it is in the Uffizi Gallery, in Florence. \r\nThe “Head of Medusa” executed by Caravaggio, in 1598, was commissioned as a cerimonial shield by Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, the Medici family’s agent in Rome, after seeing, on the painters studio, the first version – The Metula painting. The purpose of this commissioned was to symbolize the Grand Duke of Tuscany's courage in defeating his enemies. For its subject matter, Caravaggio drew on the Greek myth of Medusa, a woman with snakes for hair who turned people to stone by looking at them. \r\nMedusa was a Gorgon monster, a terrifying female creature from the Greek Mythology. While descriptions of Gorgons vary across Greek literature, the term commonly refers to any of three sisters who had hair of living, venomous snakes, and a horrifying visage that turned those who beheld it to stone. Traditionally, while two of the Gorgons were immortal, Stheno and Euryale , their sister Medusa was not, and was slain by the mythical hero Perseus, the legendary founder of Mycenae and of the Perseid dynasty. According to the story, she was killed by Perseus, who avoided direct eye contact by using a mirrored shield. After Medusa’s death, her decapitated head continued to petrify those that looked at it. \r\nCaravaggio plays with this concept by modeling himself for Medusa’s face – making him the only one who is safe from Medusa’s dedly gaze – and having to look at his reflection to paint the shield in the same way that Medusa caught her own image moments before being killed. Although Caravaggio depicts Medusa’s severed head, she remains conscious. He heightens this combination of life and death through Medusa’s intense expression. Her wide-open mouth exudes a silent but dramatic scream and her shocked eyes and furrowed brow all suggest a sense of disbelief, as if she thought herself to be invincible until the moment. But Caravaggio’s Medusa does not have the full effect of scaring the viewer, since she does not look at us, thereby transferring the power of the gaze to the viewer and emphasizing her demise. Caravaggio displays huge technical achievements in this work by making a convex surface look concave and Medusa’s head appear to project outward."},{"title":"Girl in Bed","artistName":"Freud

Alfred, Lord Tennyson. The poems retell the story of King Arthur and his knights, the rise and fall of his kingdom, and his love for Guinevere, and her subsequent betrayal of him. Tennyson’s retelling of the Arthur legends was a commentary on the Victorian Era of the times in which he lived, and it was a very popular literary theme during Dore’s lifetime. The cycle of narrative poems were published during Dore’s lifetime, beginning in 1856, the last one being published in 1885, two years after his death. As such, his illustrations of the poems were one of his last works before his death.

The first illustrated version of the poem appeared in the fourth edition of the work, in 1688, and later, other artists, such as William Blake and Salvador Dali have been inspired to create illustrations inspired by the work.

It was first exhibited in 1872, where it was criticized as ugly and disgusting, and a later exhibition in 1892 it was removed from the show. It was shown a year later inn England, where it sparked controversy. The woman in the painting was derided as a whore and the entire image was seen as a blow to morality and the degradation of society due to absinthe.

He creates a highly emotional story with the combination of elements of traditional Byzantine paintings, such as the dimensional layout and iconography, with his stylized faces showing an emotional response to the death of Christ. The result pulls the viewer into the scene by inviting them to witness the pain and anguish of the Lamentation. You can almost hear the sobs of the women and the shrieks from the angels above. This realistic depiction of emotion on human faces set him apart from other artists of his day, turning Christ and his followers into real human beings with real emotion."},{"title":"Campbell's Soup

metaphysical art, The Disquieting Muses was painted in the city of Ferrara, Italy, during World War I. De Chirico considered Ferrara a perfect “metaphysical city,” and used much of the cityscape of Ferrara in the painting. The large castle in the background is the Castello Estense, a medieval fortress in the center of the city. The three “muses,” in the foreground of the painting, are “disquieting” due to the fact that they were the pathway to overcome appearances and allowed the viewer to engage in a discourse with the unknown. This painting inspired a poem by Sylvia Plath, also entitled “The Disquieting Muses.”"},{"title":"Self-Portrait with Seven Digits","artistName":"Chagall Marc","artistContentId":202355,"completitionYear":1913,"yearAsString":"1913","width":858,"height":1004,"image":"https://uploads6.wikiart.org/images/marc-chagall/self-portrait-with-seven-digits-autoportrait-1913.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":202989,"artistUrl":"marc-chagall","url":"self-portrait-with-seven-digits-autoportrait-1913","location":"ParisFrance","period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"self-portrait","material":null,"style":"Cubism","technique":null,"sizeX":107,"sizeY":128,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, Netherlands","tags":"arts-and-crafts, male-portraits, famous-people, pictures-and-drafts, Marc-Chagall","description":null},{"title":"Trumpet","artistName":"Basquiat Jean-Michel ","artistContentId":203777,"completitionYear":1984,"yearAsString":"1984","width":1891,"height":1888,"image":"https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/jean-michel-basquiat/trumpet.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":203931,"artistUrl":"jean-michel-basquiat","url":"trumpet","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"figurative","material":null,"style":"Neo-Expressionism","technique":null,"sizeX":152.4,"sizeY":152.4,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Private Collection","tags":null,"description":null},{"title":"Composition No.10","artistName":"Mondrian Piet","artistContentId":185969,"completitionYear":1942,"yearAsString":"1942","width":882,"height":968,"image":"https://uploads7.wikiart.org/images/piet-mondrian/composition-no-10-1942.jpg!Large.jpg","contentId":185976,"artistUrl":"piet-mondrian","url":"composition-no-10-1942","location":null,"period":null,"serie":null,"genre":"abstract","material":null,"style":"Neoplasticism","technique":null,"sizeX":73,"sizeY":79.5,"diameter":null,"auction":null,"yearOfTrade":null,"lastPrice":null,"galleryName":"Private Collection","tags":null,"description":"In Composition Number 10, Mondrian had reached the full development of his neo-plastic, non-representational form. Many of his paintings contained the basic elements of an interlocking grid of black lines and blocks of the three primary colors. Although the elements were few, he changed the structure of each of the elements in such a way that he was able to create a different aesthetic from each. It was in this later period of his work that Mondrian work until his hands blistered or he made himself cry. During this time, he was also rearranging and painting his Manhattan studio apartment in a similar grid and block pattern, which he changed and re-painted upon completion off certain canvases or projects.
