Timeline visualization of a selection of well known artists' oeuvres. 

This project was built for a NYC 'Creative Technology' Event in 2018, where I went to represent Microsoft. Syncing with the HoloLens, these works were projected on a wall, allowing one to explore a slice of an artist's progression in their own space.

I thought of it again during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even if just by time, it feels significant to see an artist's paintings presented cohesively. Rather than the fragmented way I normally experience snips and shots of art online. So I published it via Github's free pages.
